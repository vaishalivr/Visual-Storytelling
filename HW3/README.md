You will find a selection of universal design principles below. Pick one of the following design principles and read the accompanying PDF as part of your reading for the week. After you have read your chosen design principle,  prepare a short three-minute presentation on it for Week 4. Please do not take more than three minutes to present.

Format: Slide presentation. You may use up to three slides. Please submit your assignment/presentation in pdf format. At the same time, please post this assignment in the discussion thread (for assignment 3).

Content: You must describe the principle you chose in the slides, and how they might relate to information visualization (you may include an example of an existing visualization that incorporates the principle if you'd like). You must also create a visualization in a design program that demonstrates the chosen principle for inclusion in the slides. Create a clear hierarchy for the slides (you can practice with this this tool
