Make a visualization more inclusive

Pick a previously made data visualization and remake it to be more inclusive. Think about the situations it may be present in, both because of your chosen format, and diversity of the audience. 

Format: Choose a specific format and create an artboard (or artboards) that reflects the relative proportions. Examples of formats: Mobile phone (vertical, scrollable layout or swipeable slides), Billboard, Poster, Pamphlet or Booklet, etc. Your design many need to change significantly to make it more inclusive. Submit this assignment as a PDF.

Content: You may pick a data visualization you’ve previously made, or use another existing one that is appears exclusionary. Use any of methods where appropriate to make it more inclusive, and others you can think of:

· Descriptive introduction of what the visualization shows
· Direct labeling
· Include values along with the visual representations of them
· Sufficient contrast and color segmentation
· Appropriate text size and clear hierarchy
· Optionally, choose a different visualization type

Along with your submission, please leave a comment with what you've changed and why.
