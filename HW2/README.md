Imagine you'll be sharing information with two different audiences. Design two versions of the same information graphic that employs at least three different feature channels (see pages 27 to 42 in Visual Thinking for Design) to consciously attract our attention and create a strong visual structure. Think about how you want to come across to each audience. Will the typefaces be different? The language you use? The color palette? Maybe the visualization type itself. It can be helpful to start by sketching, though you're not required to submit sketches.

REQUIREMENTS:

    Create two separate data visualizations of the same general information
    Use a grid in each layout. It should not be visible in your PDF submission, so include a separate screenshot that shows your grid.
    Use feature channels to deliver at least 3 key pieces of information. The 3 feature channels can be combined in a single visualization, or shown in a sequence. For the pieces of information about endangered species, you might consider WHERE they are endangered, WHICH animals are most endangered, WHY (the causes) of endangerment, etc...
    Use data from a source below. You may use alternate data, but you must get approval from the instructor first.

DATA:

Feel free to use any of the following resources.

    Here is an article on the topic. https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/05/27/1922686117

The article refers to a dataset (PDF).
Other data on the same theme can be found at https://www.iucnredlist.org

    There is another dataset that might be useful, listing threatened mammal species by country. You can find it under "Resources" in the week 2 module in Canvas. It is not a perfectly clean and complete data set.

FORM OF VISUALIZATION: Up to you, but try and avoid default settings. Submit this assignment as a PDF.

STORYTELLING: Do a little research on threatened mammals and the causes for their dilemma.  This is a huge topic and this is not a test of your knowledge of endangered species, so do not obsess with being absolutely accurate. Focus your efforts on attracting our attention and delivering your message.

All assignments are due by 3:00AM ET Wednesday, the night before class.
