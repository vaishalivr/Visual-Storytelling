    Data can be about your daily life, or anything is easily gathered that interests you.
    Draft a sketch that embodies the subject matter in some way. Consider how form, color, and sizing, can best represent the data.
    Create that concept in a design program of your choice (Adobe Illustrator, Figma, etc). Include text for the visualization (title and labels or a key). Try to avoid the default settings.
    Be prepared to share your sketch and visualization during our next class and talk about some decisions you made and how you attempted to create it in the design program.
    Submit a picture of your sketch and a vector file (ie: PDF, ) of your design

All assignments are due by 3:00 am (EST) Wednesday, the night before class.
