# Visual-Storytelling
Home Work 1
In this assignment, I chose to show some personal data about the countries I am loosly associated with.
Wrote small javascript code to make circles that do not overlap each other and to download the output as svg.
Took the svg into illustrator to work on it further to add personal data.

Attempt 2:
Had a class about grids, so inclined to do this again using grids.
Also circles are arranged in a random manner, trying to look to add some logic there.
